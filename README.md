# Design in DfE Documentation

This site documents the content, service and interaction design principles, standards and guidance that we expect teams working
within the [Department for Education (DfE)](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-education)
to follow when designing services.

It complements the following GOV.UK guidance:

- [GDS Service Manual](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual)
- [Writing for GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/content-design/writing-for-gov-uk)
- [design system](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/)

This documentation should be used in conjunction with the
[DfE Digital Technical Guidance](https://dfe-digital.github.io/technical-guidance) for awareness of the wider technical requirements when designing and building services.
